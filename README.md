For this weeks homework our assignment was to create a working and live site where we will be able too store our work that we complete throughout the class.
This particular assignment gave me trouble in a couple of places:
  1. Positioning the pictures w/ padding
  2. Spacing out the content in the Contact-me section
  3. The border line in the middle separating the two headers and the content
The header links all work and when they are clicked they direct you to that specific area.
The first application when scrolling to the work section is sized the biggest and all rest are smaller and sized the same. Currently, the images there are placeholder images because I don't have any webpages to showcase.
